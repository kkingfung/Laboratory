# 📖 Race Lore: Tyrant

Explore the background and philosophies of the ten factions fighting for control of Tyrak.

---

## 🔥 Demon — King Vraxxion, the Flame Sovereign
Once a mortal warlord who burned down kingdoms for sport, Vraxxion made a pact with the Abyss to become a true demon. His ascension set the Infernal Realms ablaze, and he now rules from a volcano that weeps molten blood. Vraxxion views strategy as ritual sacrifice — every card played must bleed.
> _"Power isn’t earned. It’s taken and sealed with fire."_

---

## 🧟 Undead — Queen Malthera, the Eternal Mourner
Once a benevolent queen who died protecting her people from a cursed plague. Her soul refused to rest, and through necromantic ritual, she returned — not to save her kingdom, but to rule its bones. Her court is a graveyard, her mercy a whisper from the grave.
> _"In death, I found loyalty. In rot, obedience."_

---

## 🧌 Troll — Warlord Brogmar the Unbending
Towering, ageless, and scarred from centuries of tribal warfare, Brogmar leads by smashing both enemies and doubters. He respects only strength and tradition, with every wound on his hide a memory carved into stone. He considers tactics an insult — overwhelming force is the only answer.
> _"I don’t outthink. I outlast."_

---

## 👺 Goblin — General Boomjaw the Unpredictable
No one knows who Boomjaw I or II were, and he probably made up the title. A chaotic genius and reckless inventor, Boomjaw leads the goblin hordes with gadgetry, explosives, and complete disregard for logic. His plans rarely go as intended — but always end with a bang.
> _"Order is for people with no imagination."_

---

## 👻 Ghost — Empress Elarion of the Twilight Court
Empress Elarion died in a palace coup, her voice silenced in a single breath. But the spirits of her loyal retainers brought her back as a shade, ruling from the border between life and afterlife. Her command is emotionless, yet every whisper carries sorrow and judgment.
> _"The throne was never empty. You just couldn’t see me."_

---

## 😈 Succubus — Lady Selnara, the Crimson Whisper
Selnara weaves empires not with armies, but with seduction and secrets. Each rival kingdom fell one lover at a time, until all bowed to her charm. Her palace is a theater of manipulation, where a smile kills faster than steel. She leads with allure — and cruelty hidden beneath silk.
> _"No need to fight. Just tell me your deepest desire."_

---

## 🌲 Tree Man — High Elder Myrrden of the Deeproots
Ancient as the first rains, Myrrden is less ruler than shepherd. He speaks with the forest and moves only when the land demands war. Trees twist when he commands. Though slow to act, his vengeance — like the roots beneath — is vast and patient.
> _"Time bends to those who wait."_

---

## 🦎 Lizard Man — Matriarch Xak'Thiss of the Swampscale
A cunning hunter and broodmother, Xak'Thiss rules the swamp clans through fear, venom, and divine visions. She claims the ancestors speak through her venom trances, guiding her cold-blooded strategies. Warm-bloods are prey. So are disobedient kin.
> _"One hiss, and the jungle answers in silence."_

---

## 🗿 Gargoyle — Lord Kharazul, the Stonebound Sentinel
Chiseled from sacred ruins and awakened by ancient magic, Kharazul remembers when the world was new. His rule is not loud, but unshakable. He commands the skies, watching silently from towering heights, judging the sins of mortals below.
> _"Ages pass. I endure."_

---

## 🧝‍♀️ Dark Elf — Queen Nyssira Duskthorn
Elegant and ruthless, Nyssira ascended to the throne through assassinations cloaked in courtly smiles. Her rule is strict but precise, thriving in the shadows between diplomacy and death. Every decision is a dagger behind velvet.
> _"Light blinds. Darkness reveals."_
